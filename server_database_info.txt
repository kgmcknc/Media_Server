first time server runs, it gets random number for unique device id
all new devices that attach are given an idea from the main server
status flag for if you are main server or not (main server has full webpage, sub clients have limited pages...)
holds information for all devices on the server, device status, current ip addresses of all connected devices

use broadcast packet to send out a ping broadcasting your own settings:
   what unique server you are assigned to
   your name
   your ip


whenever new client is present that hasn't been connected we can show that to webpage
whenever a web accept happens, we then give a device an id in the server list. this links the device and is unique to all devices
devices can also have name and could include what options are allowed on a device...
a device could serve everything but can't play media, it could serve everything and play media, it could have alarm/sensors or not

maybe make defined standard for any options the server can do:
   Server Ability: Enabled/Disabled : unique port number to interface (could be 0 to use default server port)
   Play Media : enabled : #
   Output Alarms : enabled : #
   Input Sensors : enabled : #
