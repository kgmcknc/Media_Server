Add header file that deploys and has different contents from main or pi (server or client) and is read when sys_control starts and populates a byte (need to add) to the config file.
Byte tells the process whether it is server or client.
The server and client do different things if the byte/config file is set.
Add server active to config too
Add functions to write/read config data (rather than just having command line config interface). This allows web config and read.
Then add polling/keep alive/active from functions and global broadcast across the system.
